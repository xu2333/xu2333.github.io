title: Under the Lake -- Original Broad Game
---

I am a loyal fan of Sid Meier's Civilization. That's the simple but powerful reason for me to design *Under the Lake*.

At the beginning, 3 talented undergraduates joined my group. They mainly undertook the task of designing graphics while I took charge of designing rules.
Based on vast system of Civilization 5, I simplified the tedious operations and added events with randomness to suit the demand of board game.

Before ask my friends to play it, I developed a simulation program, calculating the probability of victory for each civilization.
Although it only contained a few simple cases, I did initial numerical design based on it.

During our games in 3-8 players, I was queried too many times to remember. Sometimes I could not answer to their questions and had to make up an explanation to keep the game going. 
But I got not only essential data for further improvement but also the great joy to play a self-designed game.

Finally, we finished the [**Player's Handbook**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xu2333/xu2333.github.io/master/pdf/under_the_lake.pdf) (in Chinese).

It can not be understand at the first sight. Challenging games are always fascinating with exploration.
