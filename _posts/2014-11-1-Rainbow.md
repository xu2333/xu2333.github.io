title: Rainbow -- An APP for Team Games
---

*Rainbow* was my first entrepreneurship program with 3 other undergraduates from Financial Management, Business Administration and Advertisement Design.

The objective of our APP was to provide suitable team games for groups according to the characteristics of each member.
We collected a set of 106 different group games, for which we set up a series of match value to describe the most fitting condition.
Once receiving a query, *Rainbow* would return a list of requested games sorted by match value.

After I developed a corresponding APP in Java by myself, I added some essential functions of commercial APPs; however, just in non-formal way.

Our [**Business Plan**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xu2333/xu2333.github.io/master/pdf/rainbow.pdf) (in Chinese) won several awards on various venture business plan competition and finally got an investment of 8000 RMB from Startup Support Fund.
