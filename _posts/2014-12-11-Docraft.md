title: DOcraft -- OpenGL Building Reproduction
---

Do you like to build a house which conforms to your poetic imagination? In Minecraft, dreams always come true.

This time I build authentic ones in OpenGL. My course project of Computer Graphics was constructing the dormitory of myself.

Our [**Project Report**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xu2333/xu2333.github.io/master/pdf/DOcraft.pdf) (in Chinese) detailed each module in our project.
I were responsible for drawBalcony, render_door, Draw_Skybox(draw distant scenery), BMP(read in textures) and NURBS(draw quilt).
Maybe those rough textures are easy to be seen through, but I still consider it as my sweet home.

My teammates implemented those chairs and bathroom accessories with OBJ and simulated running water by particle effects.
